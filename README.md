# Performability of 5G infrastructures

The code implements the Multidimensional Universal Generating Function (MUGF) method adopted to characterize performability of 5G infrastructures as detailed in the paper entitled "Performability of Service Chains with Rejuvenation: A Multidimensional Universal Generating Function Approach"
by Luigi De Simone, Mario Di Mauro, Roberto Natella, Fabio Postiglione.

The code has been tested on Wolfram (TM) Mathematica version 12.X.
It is enough to copy/paste the software code into a file with extension .nb and load it in Mathematica.

The values of parameters are the same of the paper (but they can be changed to test different configurations).
Please also note that all the comments in the Mathematica code are enclosed into (*...*).
